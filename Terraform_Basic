Terraform defination - Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp 
                        that allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files.

Benefits of Using Terraform
                        -->Version-controlled infrastructure
                        -->Reusable and modular configs
                        -->Multi-cloud support
                        -->Safe and predictable deployments
In this terraform we have few impotant files that we have to know and we have to mainatain .tf extention for this files to identify easily
                1.main.tf
                2.variable.tf
                3.output.tf 

1.main.tf - which is aslo called as main configuration file
                -->Defines the provider (e.g., AWS, Azure).
                -->Declares resources to create (e.g., EC2 instance, S3 bucket).
                -->This is the core file where your infrastructure is described.
        Example-        provider "aws" {
                                region  = "us-east-1"
                                profile = var.aws_profile
                                }
                        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
                                ami  = "ami-xxxxxxx"
                                instance_type = var.instance_type  #where we mention in the variable.tf file so takes the t2.larger instance type 
                                                            }

2.variable.tf - which is aslo called as input file
                -->Declares variables you can pass into your configuration.
                -->Helps make your code reusable and flexible
        Example -
                        variable "instance_type" {
                        description = "The instance type"
                        type        = string
                        default     = "t2.large"  


3.ouput.tf -Shows important results after Terraform runs and  Useful for displaying IP addresses, resource IDs, etc.
        Example - output "instance_id" {
                  value = aws_instance.example.id
                                        }
