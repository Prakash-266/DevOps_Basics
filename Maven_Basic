-->whenever we want to deploy java_code application file to run in server for that we have to make sure that server have the java_software  to run that particular java_application
so we can all that java_software as a dependencies
-->POM (Projext Object Model)-use XML language in this file we have project related infomation
-->in this process the java_file convert intlo jar ,var files then only we can deploy a code ina server
About .jar & .tar & Ear files
------------------------
-whenever we complie the java_file it will convert into .jar file 
-along with java_code we have xml,html in that file it will convert into .war file
-cobination of .jar+tar file called as .Ear file

Project_Structure
source_code--->Project_Struture--->Dependencies/library--->Test--->Reporting

Build_Tools
.Net : V ishual_Studio
c,c++:make file
Java :Ant,Maven,Gradle

MAVEN --> maven is the project management or dependencie management tool which is used to create the no.of projects in a particular structure
          and developed by apache software foundation
Architecture:


                               build_System 
                                
                                POM.XML            --> CENREL_REPO
        local repo  --->       -----------    
                                  MAVEN            --> REMOTE_REPO
                                    |
                                  SITE

MAVEN_LIFE_CYCLE
-----------------
1.generate a resources (source_Code)
2.complie code  -mvn complie
3.Test          -mvnn test
4.package       -mvn package
5.install       -mvn install
6.Deploy(to server)

so we give a directory in artifact section that is the project directory_name
After creating the structure
curent location apache_mavem-3.8.6}# 
--check the list       -ll 
--Go to directory      - cd diretory
In that directory you can have pom.xml & src/ directory
 inside the src  diretcory it creates 
cd src/ -main/ test/ directories ,
cd main/ -java/
cd java/ -batch/
cd batch -app.java file
cat app.java --- we can see the simple hello world code
full path -cd diretory/src/main/java/batch/
=====
move to directory for compile make sure when you use complile where the artifactid (directory in my exmaple)
--mvn complie (use get success)
now check --ll 
after compliation you get target directory
###moving inside -ls target/ - classes/(in this batch/) generated-sources maven-status ,,ls target/ classes/batch/app.class file (observe that out app.java convert into app.class)
--mvn test (use get success)
--mvn package (then we will get jar,war file and it shows the path too actually save n target  folder)
now we want to store that file in local repo
--mvn install  (then see the path)
==========================================================================================================================================================================
 ANOTHER WAY OF TO USE MAVEN-GITHUB

1.copy the github repo url
2.git clone url ##make sure that git installation
3.ll ##it display repo directory
4. we already install the maven and its dependencies(java_software) 
5.cd github_repo
6.mvn compile (build_success so we get target folder)
7.mvn test (success)
8.mvn package (convert the source_Code file into jar file)
9.mvn install (it will save the .jar file into our local repo)
it create .m2 directoryinto u r local repo
